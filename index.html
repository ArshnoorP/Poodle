    <h2>Why Bagheera Means So Much to Me</h2>
    <p>Bagheera has been part of my life for four years, and he is not just a pet—he is my baby. From the beginning, Bagheera made sure I never had a boring moment. I still remember how he used to bite me as a puppy—tiny teeth, lots of energy! Now, he is the sweetest companion anyone could ask for.</p>
